      Some knew Martin Luther King Jr. personally, others admired him from afar. All were inspired by him. Here, civil rights activists reflect on King.

          <p>
            CHARLES JOHNSON is the Pollock Professor of English at the University of Washington and a winner in 1998 of a prestigious "genius grant" from the MacArthur Foundation. His novel, "Middle Passage," won the National Book Award for 1990 and his short fiction is much anthologized, including on the Internet.

          <p>
            An accomplished screenwriter, book reviewer, and comic artist, Johnson has wrote a novel called "Dreamer," centering on events in the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Before the novel was published in the spring of 1998, he discussed some of what he learned about King, and what he discovered about himself — and society — in the process.

        <h1>Then and now: Two pastors talk about the struggle for equality</h1>

        <div class="bio">
          <p>
            In 1958, just as the civil rights movement in the South was starting to gain national attention, two pastors moved to Seattle to take over new assignments: the Rev. Samuel McKinney at the predominately black Mt. Zion Baptist Church, and the Rev. Dale Turner at the predominately white University Congregational Church.

          <p>
            A year or two later, Turner invited McKinney to speak at University Congregational; that visit was followed by a number of informal meetings between the two and a third pastor, John Hurst Adams (who has since left the area), to talk about ways of addressing race relations from the pulpit.

          <p>
            More than 35 years after they first met, the Revs. Turner and McKinney sat down again in December, 1995, for a conversation with Seattle Times religion reporter Lee Moriwaki.

          <p>
            They talked about the mood of the times then and now, and about the impact of Martin Luther King Jr. — a classmate of McKinney's at Morehouse College. Below is an edited transcript of the discussion.
