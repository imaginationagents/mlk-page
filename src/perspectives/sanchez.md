# Sonia Sanchez speaks

Noted poet and activist Sonia Sanchez visited Seattle in November 1995 to promote her latest book of poetry, "Wounded in the House of A Friend." These sound files contain excerpts from a short interview at Elliott Bay Book Company.

Sanchez had met King once, during a stop on his book tour shortly before he was stabbed in 1957. Though she does not think King or Malcolm X or the Kennedys will "come again," Sanchez says she believes that good leaders will always come as the times demand.
